We’re on a journey to forever
Dreams eternal, in a wondrous world without walls
We are Forever, wondering what the future holds

I hear you, a distant voice inside my brain
I see you, so clear, though you're so far away
United, together though we're miles apart
Undivided, a symbiosis of the heart
We’re all connected, a never-ending synergy
We’re a collective, an infinite community
Immortal harmony, eternal unity

I’m ready to dive into this brave new world
Commencing the morning of our second birth
It’s coming, the rising of a glorious age
It’s starting, the dawn of a superior race
We’re all connected, a never-ending synergy
We’re a collective, an infinite community
Immortal harmony, eternal unity

We’re on a journey to forever
Dreams eternal, in a wondrous world without walls
We are Forever, wondering what the future holds
We’re on a journey to forever
Dreams eternal, in a wondrous world without walls
We are Forever, wondering what the future holds
We’re on a journey to forever
Dreams eternal, in a wondrous world without walls
We are Forever, wondering what the future holds

We’re all connected, a never-ending synergy
Our minds have melded, a singular society
We’re a collective, an infinite community
A perfect symmetry, immortal harmony, eternal unity
