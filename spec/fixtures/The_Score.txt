"We all die. The goal isn't to live forever.
The goal is to create something that will."

I keep on hearing them saying what I should do
I, I've come to see it through to the end of the line

And the end of my commission
Is the actual condition of my life
I begin my transformation
To the only definition of what's right

So leave the world behind
I follow all my deepest desires
Remember every sign
From the past, it took me higher than life

So leave the world behind
And I follow all my deepest desires
Remember every sign
From the past, it took me higher than life

We're gonna settle the score

My, my questions keep on lingering one at the time
I, I've come so far but yet it's the end of the line

And the outset of sedition
Is the single premonition that I Ô¨Ånd
So my ultimate decision
And the final destination I combine

So leave the world behind
I follow all my deepest desires
Remember every sign
From the past, it took me higher than life

We're gonna settle the score

I open the gateways to something exceptional
In the eye of the storm, I deny the delusional

So leave the world behind
I follow all my deepest desires
Remember every sign
From the past, it took me higher than life

So leave the world behind (So leave the world behind)
I follow all my deepest desires
Remember every sign (Remember every)
From the past, it took me higher than life

We're gonna settle the score
